This poster presentation evaluated the Noah-MP land surface model with plant hydraulics scheme (Noah-MP-PHS), presented at the Advancing Land Modeling Symposium.

## Research Focus
Comprehensive evaluation of the Noah-MP land surface model enhanced with a plant hydraulics scheme, examining its performance in simulating land-atmosphere interactions.

## Key Components
- **Model**: Noah-MP with Plant Hydraulics Scheme (PHS)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Performance assessment across multiple variables
- **Applications**: Improved land surface modeling for climate and weather prediction

## Presentation History
This research was also presented as a poster at:
- JSG Research Symposium, Austin, TX (February 2025)
- Advancing Land Modeling Symposium, Austin, TX (August 2025)

## Scientific Significance
The Noah-MP-PHS model represents an advancement in land surface modeling by incorporating detailed plant hydraulic processes, leading to more accurate representations of water and energy fluxes between land and atmosphere.

## Research Impact
This work contributes to improving Earth system models and enhancing our understanding of land-atmosphere coupling processes, with implications for climate prediction and water resource management.
