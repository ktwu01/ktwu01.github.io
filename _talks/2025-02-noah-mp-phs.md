This poster presentation evaluated the Noah-MP land surface model with plant hydraulics scheme (Noah-MP-PHS), presented at the Jackson School of Geosciences Research Symposium at UT Austin.

## Abstract
The Noah-MP land surface model with plant hydraulics scheme represents an important advancement in modeling plant-water interactions in Earth system models. This presentation evaluated the performance of Noah-MP-PHS in simulating land surface processes, with particular focus on plant hydraulic stress and water transport mechanisms.

## Key Points
- Evaluation of Noah-MP-PHS performance against observational data
- Analysis of plant hydraulic stress representation in land surface models
- Implications for improving Earth system model predictions
- Integration with AI/ML approaches for model optimization

## Research Context
This work is part of ongoing research at UT Austin's Jackson School of Geosciences, focusing on improving physics-based land surface models through AI-enhanced approaches.
