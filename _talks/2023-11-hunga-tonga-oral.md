This oral presentation discussed the research findings on perturbations caused by the 2022 Hunga-Tonga volcano eruption in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region, combining WACCM-X simulation results with meteor radar observations.

## Abstract
The 2022 Hunga-Tonga volcano eruption provided a unique opportunity to study how volcanic events can affect the upper atmosphere. This research combined sophisticated climate modeling using WACCM-X with ground-based meteor radar observations to investigate atmospheric perturbations in the MLT region.

## Key Findings
- Re-confirmed that a single volcano can send shockwaves around Earth
- Comprehensive analysis combining modeling and observational data
- Novel insights into volcano-atmosphere interactions in the upper atmosphere
- Implications for understanding space weather and atmospheric coupling

## Related Publications
This work was later presented at AGU 2023 and contributed to ongoing research in atmospheric dynamics and space physics.

## Research Impact
The research demonstrated the global-scale impact of volcanic eruptions on upper atmospheric dynamics, with implications for satellite operations and space weather prediction.
