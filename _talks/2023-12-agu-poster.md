Poster presentation at the 2023 AGU Fall Meeting investigating the atmospheric perturbations caused by the 2022 Hunga-Tonga volcano eruption in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region.

## Abstract
This research investigates the far-reaching effects of the 2022 Hunga-Tonga volcano eruption on the mesosphere and lower thermosphere using both WACCM-X climate model simulations and ground-based meteor radar observations. The study provides crucial insights into how major volcanic events can influence upper atmospheric dynamics on a global scale.

## Presentation Details
- **Session**: SA33B - Atmospheric Effects of Volcanic Eruptions
- **Paper ID**: [SA33B-2892](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1358645)
- **Authors**: Wu, K.*, Liu, H.-L., Yi, W., & Xue, X.

## Key Findings
- Documented global-scale atmospheric perturbations from a single volcanic event
- Combined modeling and observational approaches for comprehensive analysis
- Demonstrated the utility of meteor radar observations for tracking upper atmospheric disturbances
- Provided insights into volcano-atmosphere coupling mechanisms

## Research Impact
This work contributes to understanding how explosive volcanic eruptions can affect global atmospheric circulation patterns and has implications for space weather prediction and satellite operations.

## Related Work
This presentation builds on ongoing research collaboration between institutions and contributes to the broader understanding of atmospheric dynamics and volcanic impacts on the Earth system.
