A comprehensive LLM text processing system integrating text polishing, AI detection, and plagiarism reduction features, developed during my internship at Beijing ZaiwenAI Technology Co., Ltd.

## Project Overview
This project represents a complete full-stack development cycle, from product design and tech stack selection to cloud deployment. The system provides intelligent text processing capabilities using state-of-the-art language models and detection algorithms.

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Celery+Redis asynchronous task queue
- **Frontend**: HTML5+JavaScript native version and Vue.js component-based refactored version
- **AI/ML**: DeepSeek-R1 API, GPTZero detection API, custom-trained RoBERTa/BERT models
- **Deployment**: Render cloud platform with GitHub Pages static hosting
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipeline

## Key Features
- **Text Polishing**: Advanced text improvement using LLM APIs
- **AI Detection**: Integration with GPTZero and custom-trained models for AI-generated content detection
- **Plagiarism Reduction**: Intelligent text rewriting to reduce similarity scores
- **Performance Optimization**: 65%+ improvement in processing efficiency through asynchronous task queues
- **Responsive Design**: Cross-platform compatibility with modern web standards

## Architecture Highlights
- RESTful API backend designed for scalability
- Asynchronous task processing for handling concurrent requests
- Modular frontend architecture allowing for easy maintenance and updates
- Cloud-native deployment with automated CI/CD pipeline

## Performance Metrics
- **Efficiency Improvement**: 65%+ increase in processing speed
- **Scalability**: Handles multiple concurrent requests efficiently
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and task queue management
