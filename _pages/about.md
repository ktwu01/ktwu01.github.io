<!-- ## About Me -->

Welcome to my personal academic website. Hey there! 欢迎来到这儿，很高兴认识你！ I’m Koutian "KT" Wu (<ruby>吴叩天<rp>(</rp><rt>Wú Kòu Tiān</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>), a Proud Longhorn at **UT Austin** since 2024. I’m an AI4Geoscience PhD student at UT Austin’s Jackson School of Geosciences, focusing on applying explainable machine learning to improve physics‑based land surface models, especially Noah‑MP. I hold a Bachelor of Science with Honors in Geological and Earth Sciences from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

## Research Interests

My research centers on:
- **AI for Land Surface Modeling**: Implementing explainable AI/ML to improve physics-based Noah-MP land surface modeling
- **Plant-Rock-Water Interactions**: Developing models for rock and wood moisture in land surface systems
- **High Performance Computing**: Utilizing GPU and CPU clusters for large-scale geoscience simulations
- **Model Optimization**: Physics-based land surface models including Noah-MP, CTSM, and HRLDAS

## Current Work

I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant at UT Austin and Project Admin for NCAR/CISL Allocation Project UTAA0012, "Explainable AI for Improving Physics-Based Noah-MP Land Surface Modeling of Plant–Rock–Water Interactions." This project is funded with significant computational resources including 1,000 GPU hours on NSF NCAR Derecho-GPU and 20,000 CPU core-hours.
