Dr. Zong-Liang Yang's Land Environment and Atmospheric Dynamics (LEAD) Group at UT-Austin employs satellite remote sensing, earth system modeling, and high-performance computing to advance understanding of Earth system sciences.

## Research Questions

We place a strong emphasis on the societal impact of research in Earth system sciences. Specifically, we are working to answer a wide variety of earth science questions:

- How does land shape climate, or vice versa, on all time and space scales?
- What has been the impact of human activity on the Earth?
- What is the future of our environment in the face of a changing climate, land use, and human demands?
- What is our prospect for regional and global river reanalysis? How can we predict river flows at continental and global scales?
- How accurate are climate models in simulating biosphere-hydrosphere-atmosphere interactions? What are their uncertainties? How can we improve them? How can we make decisions under uncertainty?
- Are current satellite datasets alone sufficient for monitoring our environmental conditions? How can we integrate satellite data in the decision-making process?

We strive to advance understanding and provide insights into these critical questions, contributing to the broader field of Earth system sciences.
