In an era driven by code, collaboration, and transparency, GitHub has become synonymous with the "open source" spirit. But if we turn our gaze to the world of finance, we find a pioneer of "open source" who predates the birth of GitHub by a full half-century. His name is Warren Buffett.

### 👴 Buffett's "Open Source" Investment Philosophy

Warren Buffett's investment career began in 1956 when he founded the Buffett Partnership Ltd. However, the true beginning of him "open-sourcing" his investment philosophy can be traced back to 1977, the year he published his first letter to shareholders.

Year after year, these letters gradually became the "bible" of the investment world. In them, Buffett not only shared his portfolio and performance but, more importantly, he unreservedly explained his investment philosophy, decision-making framework, and profound insights into the market. This was unprecedented in the financial world at the time.

*   **1956**: Founded **Buffett Partnership Ltd.**, beginning his legendary investment career.
*   **1965**: Gained control of **Berkshire Hathaway**, transforming it into his primary investment vehicle.
*   **1977**: **Published his first letter to shareholders**, kicking off decades of sharing his "open source" investment ideas.
*   **From the 1980s onward**: His shareholder letters became widely circulated and essential reading for investors globally.

Buffett's approach was, in essence, a form of "open source"—he made his "intellectual code" public, allowing everyone to study, learn from, and even "fork" it.

### 💻 GitHub and the Culture of Open Source Code

In contrast, the icon of the modern technical "open source" movement, GitHub, arrived much later.

*   **2008**: **GitHub was officially launched**, with the goal of providing a platform for programmers to share, collaborate on, and reuse code.

The emergence of GitHub massively accelerated global software development collaboration and innovation, becoming the cornerstone of the modern open source movement.

### A Generational Lead in Thought Leadership

When we compare their timelines, Buffett's foresight becomes even clearer:

*   The span between Buffett's first shareholder letter (1977) and GitHub's launch (2008) is **31 years**.
*   If we count from the founding of his partnership (1956), he was **52 years ahead**.

Therefore, it is fair to say:

> **Warren Buffett's philosophy of public investment predates GitHub's model of open source code collaboration by an entire generation. He inadvertently became the "founding father of open source in finance."**

In an age of relatively closed information, Buffett used his wisdom and foresight to pioneer a new way of communicating with the world. He proved that true value lies not just in possessing knowledge, but in sharing it. From this perspective, Buffett is not only an investment master but a thought leader who transcended his era. His "open source" spirit continues to inspire us today.

在当今这个由代码、协作和透明度驱动的时代，GitHub 成为了“开源”精神的代名词。但如果我们将目光投向金融界，会发现一位“开源”的先行者，他比 GitHub 的诞生早了整整半个世纪。他就是沃伦·巴菲特。

### 🧓 巴菲特的“开源式投资”哲学

巴菲特的投资生涯始于1956年，他创立了巴菲特合伙基金（Buffett Partnership Ltd.）。然而，他真正开始“开源”他的投资思想，可以追溯到1977年，那一年，他发布了第一封致股东信。

这些信件，年复一年，逐渐成为了投资界的“圣经”。在信中，巴菲特不仅分享他的投资组合和业绩，更重要的是，他毫无保留地阐述了他的投资哲学、决策框架以及对市场的深刻洞见。这在当时的金融界是前所未有的。

*   **1956年**: 创立 **Buffett Partnership Ltd.**，开始其传奇的投资生涯。
*   **1965年**: 控制 **伯克希尔哈撒韦（Berkshire Hathaway）**，将其转型为主要的投资平台。
*   **1977年**: **首次发布致股东信**，开启了长达数十年的“开源”投资思想分享。
*   **1980年代起**: 其致股东信被广泛传播，成为全球投资者的必读之物。

巴菲特的这种做法，本质上就是一种“开源”——他将自己的“思想代码”公之于众，让所有人都能学习、借鉴，甚至“复刻”。

### 💻 GitHub 与开源代码文化

相比之下，我们今天所熟知的技术“开源”运动的代表——GitHub，则要晚得多。

*   **2008年**: **GitHub 正式上线**，其目标是为程序员提供一个共享、协作和复用代码的平台。

GitHub 的出现，极大地推动了全球软件开发的协作和创新，成为了现代开源运动的基石。

### 世代领先的投资思想家

将两者的历史放在一起比较，我们能更清晰地看到巴菲特的前瞻性：

*   从巴菲特发布第一封股东信（1977年）到 GitHub 上线（2008年），**时间跨度长达31年**。
*   如果从他创立合伙基金（1956年）算起，**更是早了52年**。

因此，我们可以说：

> **巴菲特的“公开投资哲学”比 GitHub 的“开源代码协作”早了整整一代人。他无意中成为了“金融界的开源鼻祖”。**

在那个信息相对封闭的年代，巴菲特用他的智慧和远见，开创了一种全新的与世界沟通的方式。他证明了，真正的价值不仅在于拥有知识，更在于分享知识。从这个角度看，巴菲特不仅是一位投资大师，更是一位跨越时代的思想领袖，他的“开源”精神，至今仍在激励着我们。
