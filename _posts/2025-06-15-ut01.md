## What is ut01?

**ut01** is a student-built navigation homepage that consolidates all essential UT Austin links in one place. Created by [Koutian Wu](https://github.com/ktwu01/), a UT Austin PhD student (Class of '24) to solve the frustration of navigating deep university website hierarchies and dealing with frequent login timeouts.

## Why ut01 Exists

As a UT student, I was constantly frustrated by:

- **Deep Link Navigation**: Simple tasks like checking dining balance required multiple clicks through complex menus
- **Frequent Logouts**: UT links automatically sign out, making bookmarks redirect to "Sign in with your EID" pages
- **Scattered Resources**: Essential student services spread across dozens of different portals

So I built this centralized hub that organizes everything students actually need.
