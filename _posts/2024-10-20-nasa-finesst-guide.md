# NASA FINESST Resources Guide & Links

A comprehensive guide for applying to NASA's Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST) program.

## What is FINESST?

NASA FINESST provides graduate student research funding ($50K/year for up to 3 years) for Earth Science, Planetary Science, Astrophysics, Heliophysics, and Biological & Physical Sciences.

## Key Application Components

### Anonymized Documents
- **Science/Technical/Management (STM)**: 6 pages
- **Open Science and Data Management Plan (OSDMP)**: 2 pages
- **Mentoring Plan**: 2 pages
- **References**: Cited works

### Non-Anonymized Documents
- **Research Readiness Statement**: 1 page
- **Biosketches**: PI and Future Investigator
- **Budget**: Detailed breakdown
- **Current & Pending Support**

## Dual Anonymous Peer Review (DAPR)

NASA's DAPR guidelines require that reviewers do not see personal or institutional identifiers in the main science proposal:

- Do **not** say "my previous work" or identify your lab's unique data
- Use neutral, third-person approach to reference prior publications
- Omit specific collaborators' names or small-group campaigns
- Number your citations (e.g., [1], [2]) instead of author-year

## Success Strategies

### Successful Research Approaches:
1. **Satellite Data Applications**: Leveraging space-based observations for global-scale studies
2. **Multi-Disciplinary Studies**: Combining different data sources and methodologies
3. **Validation Studies**: Product validation and quality assessment

### Key Success Patterns:
- Strong research collaborations
- Clear scientific objectives
- Focus on high-impact research questions
- International partnerships
- Demonstrated progress
- Well-structured proposals

## Application Process

1. **Set Up NSPIRES**: Register at [nspires.nasaprs.com](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/index.do)
2. **Prepare Required Documents**: Both anonymized and non-anonymized sections
3. **Coordinate with Institution**: Work with Office of Sponsored Projects
4. **Upload & Finalize**: PI releases to organization, AOR submits
5. **Await Notification**: Results typically announced a few months later

## Review Criteria

NASA evaluates FINESST proposals on four main criteria:

1. **Scientific/Technical Merit**
2. **Relevance to NASA**
3. **Research Readiness** (FI's background, timeline feasibility)
4. **Cost Reasonableness** (budget clarity, adherence to $50K/year limit)

## FAQ

**Q: Can non-US citizens apply?**
A: Yes, if enrolled at a U.S. institution. Check official guidelines.

**Q: Is NASA data required?**
A: Earth Science proposals must show clear link to NASA data (satellite data, airborne campaigns).

**Q: What is the typical selection rate?**
A: Usually around 15% across divisions (varies each cycle).
