Today I had an interesting experience collaborating with Claude Code to completely overhaul my personal academic website. As a PhD student in Geological and Earth Sciences at UT Austin, I needed to update my GitHub Pages site with real professional information instead of the placeholder content that had been sitting there.

## The Challenge

My website (ktwu01.github.io) was built using the Academic Pages template, but it was filled with sample data - generic publications, placeholder talks, and mock teaching experiences. I had all my real information organized in LaTeX files in my cloud storage, but manually converting everything to Jekyll markdown format would have been time-consuming and error-prone.

## The Collaboration Process

What impressed me most about working with Claude Code was its systematic approach:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Claude Code first examined the existing website structure and my source files to understand the data format and required transformations.

2. **Content Verification**: It carefully cross-referenced my LaTeX CV sections with the information I provided, ensuring complete accuracy including proper author attributions (asterisks for corresponding authors) and citation formats.

3. **Systematic Updates**: The AI methodically updated each section:
   - Publications with proper DOI links and data availability
   - Conference talks and presentations with accurate venues and dates
   - Teaching experience with detailed responsibilities
   - Portfolio projects showcasing my AI/ML and geoscience work

## Technical Details

The collaboration involved updating multiple Jekyll collections:
- `_publications/` - Added my JGR: Space Physics paper and education research
- `_talks/` - Included presentations from AGU, NASA workshops, and JSG symposium
- `_teaching/` - Documented my TA experience with Earth in 2100 (520+ students)
- `_portfolio/` - Showcased my AI projects including the NCAR-funded Noah-MP research

## Quality Assurance

What really stood out was Claude Code's attention to detail. When I asked it to double-check everything, it found and fixed several accuracy issues:
- Missing corresponding author asterisks in citations
- A forgotten AGU presentation that should have been included
- Proper venue name formatting

## Lessons Learned

This experience highlighted how AI tools can be incredibly effective for:
- **Data Transformation**: Converting between different formats (LaTeX â†’ Markdown)
- **Accuracy Verification**: Cross-referencing multiple data sources
- **Best Practice Compliance**: Ensuring proper Jekyll formatting and academic standards
- **Systematic Organization**: Managing complex, multi-file updates

The key was providing Claude Code with comprehensive source materials and being explicit about accuracy requirements. The "double-check everything" approach caught important details that could have been missed.

## Looking Forward

As someone working at the intersection of AI and geoscience, this collaboration was a practical demonstration of how AI tools can augment academic workflows. The website now accurately reflects my research on explainable AI for Noah-MP land surface modeling, my internships developing AI evaluation systems, and my broader work in space physics and Earth system science.

The updated site serves as both a professional portfolio and a testament to effective human-AI collaboration in academic contexts.
