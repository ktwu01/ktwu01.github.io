This paper investigates the diurnal and seasonal variations of meteor speed and arrival angle observed by the Mengcheng meteor radar. The study provides valuable insights into meteoroid dynamics in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere region, contributing to our understanding of space weather and atmospheric physics.

## Key Findings
- Systematic analysis of meteor observations using the Mengcheng meteor radar
- Documentation of diurnal and seasonal patterns in meteor characteristics
- Implications for understanding atmospheric dynamics and space debris
